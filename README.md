This project is made to Zero-config proxy  and Docker COmpose generator for Docker containers.

ðŸš€ What Is MicroDeploy?

MicroDeploy is a CLI tool that auto-generates:

âœ… nginx.conf (reverse proxy)

âœ… docker-compose.yml (service orchestration)
â€¦from a single config.yaml file that defines your microservices.

You no longer need to manually write Dockerfiles, Compose files, or reverse proxy rules for every service.
MicroDeploy does it all for you.
