MicroDeploy is built to support multiple reverse proxy engines like NGINX, Apache, or even Traefik — without requiring users to change any core logic in the codebase.

Typical workflow would be:

```
MicroDeploy/
├── templates/
│   ├── nginx.conf.j2      # Default NGINX reverse proxy template
│   └── apache.conf.j2     # (Optional) Apache reverse proxy template
├── generator.py           # Automatically selects template based on config.yaml
├── config.yaml            # Define services and reverse proxy engine
└── ...
```

Can choose the reverse_proxy if nned for the application that need to be get deployed.

🔁 Choose reverse_proxy Only When Needed
MicroDeploy is smartly designed to allow you to include a reverse proxy only when it's required by your application architecture. Not every microservice setup needs a reverse proxy — and that’s totally okay.

By default, reverse proxy setup is optional and fully config-driven.

✅ How it works:
In your config.yaml, you can optionally specify a reverse_proxy key (e.g., nginx, apache, etc.).

If this key is present, MicroDeploy:

Looks into the /templates directory for the corresponding .j2 (Jinja2) configuration template.

Renders the config (e.g., nginx.conf, apache.conf) based on your services.

Automatically adds the reverse proxy as a service in the docker-compose.yml.


If no reverse_proxy is mentioned:

- The tool skips reverse proxy generation entirely.

- Only your application containers (frontend, backend, DB, etc.) are added to docker-compose.yml.

```
# Only generate reverse proxy config if needed
    services_with_proxy = [s for s in services if s.get('use_proxy')]
    if not services_with_proxy:
        print("ℹ️  Skipping proxy config generation: no services require it.")
        return
```
```generatorr.py``` is upated in a way to taake the reverse proxy for load balancing if needed else skip.        

- If no service requires a reverse proxy (like Nginx/Apache), the generator will skip creating nginx.conf and won’t add a proxy service to the docker-compose.yml.

- If one or more services specify use_proxy: true in config.yaml, the generator will:

- Load the correct reverse proxy template (e.g., Nginx)

- Create an nginx.conf file

- Add a proxy container (like Nginx) to the final Docker Compose setup
